    "### Vector space and subspace\n",

The space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ consists of *all column vectors with n components, i.e. n-dimensions*. $\\mathbb{R}^{1}$ is a **line**, $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a **x-y plane**, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a **3-D space**. For a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{1}$ we just need the seven components, even if the geometry is hard to visualize.\n",

The column space is a plane defined by the two column vectors. $Ax$ is actually combinations of column vectors, which will stay in the plant.
